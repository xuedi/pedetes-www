# pedetes
Minimal website shell using pedetes library, less, bootstrap.

## how to set up
Usually, the pedetes folder is somewhere else than the public http docs. I do use /var/www/libs/pedetes and then have the web docs at /var/www/sites/newSite but that is just personal preference. there will be an blank site example that does use the lib later.

 - bower install
